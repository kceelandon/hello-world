Hello all!

My name is Kcee and I am a student attending the University of Washington. I am planning on majoring in either Informatics or Computer Science as I have just discovered how amazing it is! I want to do something design/game dev/HCI related. Hoping to learn a lot more about programming and data throughout these next couple years.

Thanks for reading!
